# gfxlib

A super simple wrapper for the SDL2 C library.

On a Ubuntu/Debian system, you'll need the following package to develop with the SDL2 library: `libsdl2-dev`.
The executable needs to be linked to the SDL2 library (flag `-lSDL2` when using gcc or clang).

Type `make` to build the example and `make run` to run it.
