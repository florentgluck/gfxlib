# gfxlib

A super simple wrapper for the SDL2 C library with a few examples on how to use it.

On a Ubuntu/Debian system, you'll need the following packages to compile and run these SDL2 examples: `libsdl2-dev` and `libsdl2-image-dev`.

Type `make run` to build and run the examples located in the `examples` directory. Running `make clean` cleans up all generated files.
